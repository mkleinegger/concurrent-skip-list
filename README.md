Concurrent Library
-------------------------------

Sequential implementation, to check:
  make clean

Then with makefile we build library skiplist.so 
  make all

To run smple correctness test
  make run-test

To run small bench (still errors)
  make small-bench

Ideally make run-benchmark worksas well but for now it doesn't..
